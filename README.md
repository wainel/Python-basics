# Python_basics
This repository is created to show that I have mastered the basics of Python.

## CheckNumberAnagram  
Write a function that gets an **integer** number as input and returns a boolean type **True** or **False** based on whether the number when read backwards gives the same number. This would be the equivalent of an anagram with **strings**.
E.g. input of number 1234321 would return True.

## FindFridays
Write a function that given a start **date** and end date returns how many Fridays there are between the two dates.
start_date and end_date should be 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings, e.g. '2014-01-31'

## FindVowelsConsonants
Write a function that takes a **string** in English as input and returns the number of vowels and consonants.
For example: If the string is 'The cat is sleeping', then the function should return : (6, 10)

## MakeTeam
Write a function that takes a **dictionary** called people as input and returns 3 **lists** named cook, gardener and clerk containing the name of each individual with this job.

## Collections
The collections module implements special container datatypes and provides alternatives with some additional functionality compared to the general built-in containers, like dict, list, or tuple: Counter, namedtuple, OrderedDict, defaultdict and deque.

## Itertools
The itertools module is a collection of tools for handling iterators. It offers some advanced tools like product(), permutations(), combinations(), accumulate(), groupby(), and infinite iterators like cycle(), repeat(), and count().

## Lambda
A lambda function is a small (one line) anonymous function that is defined without a name. It is typically used when you need a simple function that is used only once in your code, or it is used as an argument to higher-order functions.
