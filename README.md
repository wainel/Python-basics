This repository is created to show that I have mastered the basics of Python.

## CheckNumberAnagram -- Integer / Boolean 
Write a function that gets an integer number as input and returns a boolean type True or False based on whether the number when read backwards gives the same number. This would be the equivalent of an anagram with strings.
E.g. input of number 1234321 would return True.

## FindFridays -- Date
Write a function that given a start date and end date returns how many Fridays there are between the two dates.
start_date and end_date should be 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings, e.g. '2014-01-31'

## FindVowelsConsonants -- String
Write a function that takes a string in English as input and returns the number of vowels and consonants.
For example: If the string is 'The cat is sleeping', then the function should return : (6, 10)

## MakeTeam -- Dictionary / List
Write a function that takes a dictionary called people as input and returns 3 lists named cook, gardener and clerk containing the name of each individual with this job.
